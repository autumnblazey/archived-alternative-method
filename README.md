# Repo Archive

Archived repositories from [Atom](https://github.com/atom) and [Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit)

## Repo structue explanation

- Every repo branch is a branch on this repo. Each repo gets its own branch prefix named after the repo to resolve naming conflicts, so for example `me/my-repo` would get that prefix, and its `master` branch would be called `me/my-repo/master` on this repo.
- Every repo tag is a tag on this repo. Each repo gets its own tag prefix just like branches, and tag names are transformed in the same way

# Repo Archive

Archived repositories from [Atom](https://github.com/atom) and [Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit)

## Repo structue explanation

- Every repo branch is a branch on this repo. Each repo gets its own branch prefix named after the repo to resolve naming conflicts, so for example `me/my-repo` would get that prefix, and its `master` branch would be called `me/my-repo/master` on this repo.
- Every repo tag is a tag on this repo. Each repo gets its own tag prefix just like branches, and tag names are transformed in the same way

## How to add to this repo

- dependencies: [fish shell](https://fishshell.com), the script is a fish script
- run `./archive-package [...repos]` where repos are in the format of `username/repo`, where `username` is a github user/org and `repo` is a repo under them.
  - If it helps, a repo may be located at `https://github.com/me/my-repo` for example, and for this url the stuff past `github.com/` will be the repo, which would be `me/my-repo`.
  - The large text in the top right corner of the github site, below the navbar, is also the same thing: ![picture of repo name in top right corner of Github website](SchermÂ­afbeelding%202022-07-25%20om%2001.05.10.png)
- The copied branches and tags are pushed by the script. The script also creates a commit to this README adding the repo to the bottom of the list. You can move it around to keep things alphabetised of course (and amend the autogenerated commit if you feel like it), then push it.
- do PRs even work due to the branched nature of the repo? probably not right?
